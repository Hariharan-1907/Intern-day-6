# Intern-day-6
"On Day 6 of my internship, I reviewed and clarified my understanding of previous topics, including login page creation, form validation, and linking pages using &lt;a href>. This day focused on strengthening my foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, preparing me for more advanced concepts in web development."
